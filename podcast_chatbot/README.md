## 💬 Example

```
You: How does the personalization recommender system work?

🤖 Stefan described it as a "recommender system with an agenda" — like Spotify 
   nudging a heavy metal listener toward country music, gradually moving patients 
   toward healthier behaviors [35:39] → https://youtube.com/watch?v=IDzhmmKeNG4&t=2139
   
   He noted this builds on collaborative filtering but adds a directional goal 
   rather than just "more of the same" [39:57] → https://youtube.com/watch?v=IDzhmmKeNG4&t=2397

## 🗂️ How Your .md Files Are Chunked

Your MD files have two chunking strategies applied simultaneously:

### Strategy A — Header Chunks
Each section header in your transcript becomes one chunk:
```
quotableClips entry:
  name: "Personalization Strategy: Agenda-Driven Recommender Systems"
  startOffset: 2139  ← exact YouTube timestamp
  url: https://youtube.com/watch?v=...&t=2139  ← deep link

→ Chunk contains ALL transcript lines under that header
→ Deep link comes directly from quotableClips (no guessing!)
```
**Best for:** "What did they say about personalization?"

### Strategy B — Sliding Window Chunks
60-second windows with 30-second overlap over all transcript lines:
```
Window 1: lines from 0s → 60s   → link &t=0
Window 2: lines from 30s → 90s  → link &t=30
Window 3: lines from 60s → 120s → link &t=60
```
**Best for:** "What exact step count did they mention?"

Both strategies are searched simultaneously and results are merged + deduplicated.

## 🔧 Tuning

**Change window size** in `md_parser.py`:
```python
chunk_by_time_window(..., window_seconds=90, step_seconds=45)
```

**Change number of results** in `chatbot.py`:
```python
rag = PodcastRAG(index=index, segments=segments, top_k=7)
```

**Switch Groq model** for better quality:
```python
rag = PodcastRAG(..., model="llama3-70b-8192")   # slower but smarter
```

**Custom episodes directory:**
```bash
python chatbot.py --episodes /path/to/your/md/files
```
