This application will create a chatbot that allows visitors to ask natural-language questions about a specific podcast episode, or the entire podcast library, and receive concise, timestamped answers with direct links to the exact moment in the video or audio.

The chatbot can use a simple RAG setup.

Example:

minsearch for retrieval (no vector DB needed)
Groq has generous free trier
Plain OpenAI/Groq API calls (no heavy agent frameworks required)
The system should load episode transcripts, retrieve relevant segments, and generate short answers that include timestamps and links to jump directly to that part of the episode.

This makes the podcast pages far more interactive and helps users quickly find insights, references, and explanations across the entire archive.
